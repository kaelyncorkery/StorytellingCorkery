        <figure class="container galleryitem navy"><img class="galleryitem navy" src="img/navy.png"><figcaption class="overlay">To celebrate Latinx Heritage Month in September, Rosa designed an exclusive tee in collaboration with Old Navy and Project We, which provides vibrant and diverse artists with a space to gain visibility and the equity they deserve. After living in NYC for a year and establishing herself back in Brazil, she has dedicated her work to highlighting social issues and subjects from an alternative perspective. This time, it's the diversity and mysticism of the Latinx community — especially Latinx women — that inspired this design.</figcaption></figure>
